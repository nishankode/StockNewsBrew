- **Urinalysis**: To rule out UTI.
- **Stool Tests**: For infections, occult blood.
- **Imaging**:
    - **Ultrasound**: For gallstones, appendicitis, reproductive issues
    - **X-ray or CT scan**: For more detailed imaging
    - **Endoscopy**: To look inside the stomach/esophagus
    - **Colonoscopy**: If lower GI issues are suspected
