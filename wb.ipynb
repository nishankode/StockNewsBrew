       "  'content': 'Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex opened sharply lower on June 13, extending losses for a second straight session, as escalating tensions in the Middle East unnerved investors. A pre-dawn Israeli strike on Iran’s capital reignited fears of a broader conflict, rattling global sentiment and weighing heavily on domestic equities. As a result, Crude oil prices surged as much as 10 percent and are up around 14 percent for the week, marking their biggest weekly gain since 2022. The spike comes amid escalating Middle East tensions, with JP Morgan warning earlier this week that oil could soar to $130 a barrel in a worst-case scenario. At about 9:25 am,\\xa0the Sensex was down 925.51 points or 1.13 percent at 80,766.47, and the Nifty was down 284.55 points or 1.14 percent at 24,603.65. About 434 shares advanced, 2308 shares declined, and 104 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates \"Indian markets took a hit as a combination of rising geopolitical tensions, trade uncertainty, and a tragic Air India crash weighed heavily on investor sentiment,\" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. \"The Indian rupee was the worst-performing Asian currency for the day, pressured by a surge in crude oil prices following Israel’s strike on Iran and growing global risk aversion,\" he added.\\xa0Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. is considering unilateral tariff hikes on several key trading partners, with a decision expected within the next one to two weeks, ahead of an early July deadline. Sectoral indices on the NSE traded largely in the red on June 13, reflecting broad-based weakness across the market. Nifty Auto, PSU Bank, and Smallcap 100 were among the worst performers, falling 1.49 percent, 1.60 percent, and 1.53 percent, respectively. Nifty Bank, IT, Metal, and Consumer Durables also saw declines of over 1 percent each. The India VIX jumped 10.77 percent to 15.53, signalling heightened market volatility. Meanwhile, indices like Nifty Energy, FMCG, Infra, Pharma, and Realty\\xa0opened flat, showing relative resilience amid the broader selloff. Shares of listed carriers like InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) and SpiceJet fell up to 4 percent in early trade as investors reacted to the Air India crash that killed 241 people. The selloff in aviation stocks was also influenced by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Global sentiment turned risk-averse after Israel launched a strike on Iran’s capital, targeting facilities reportedly linked to Tehran’s nuclear and missile programs. The Israeli government said it expected retaliatory attacks in response. Titan shares fell over a percent as JPMorgan assigned a neutral rating on the counter. The brokerage sees jewellery demand as more resilient compared to other discretionary segments and expects mid-to-high teens growth in the medium term. While demand for low-value studded jewellery is rising, high-end purchases remain muted. Margins are expected to stay steady at 11–11.5 percent despite the impact of higher duties in FY25. Potential entry into lab-grown diamonds (LGD) and overseas expansion are seen as key growth levers. From a technical perspective, the\\xa0index faced rejection near the 25,200 zone and slipped below the 9-EMA, though it continues to hold around the 20-Day SMA. This marks a pause in the ongoing uptrend, hinting at possible consolidation or mild profit booking ahead. The higher highs and higher lows remain intact on the broader time frame, but the bearish engulfing pattern raises near-term caution. The RSI has dropped from 60 to 55, indicating a decline in momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) has risen slightly, increasing intraday volatility. The immediate support remains at 24,800; a break beneath this zone could invite a sharper slide, whereas 25,100 remains a formidable ceiling on the upside. ONGC was the sole gainer on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included L&T, Shriram Finance, Tech Mahindra, NTPC, and Bajaj Finserv.

       "  'content': 'Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for another weak start, with GIFT Nifty hinting at a gap-down open near 24,600— a drop of over 370 points — as escalating tensions in the Middle East rattle global sentiment. The sharp turn comes after Israel launched a strike on Iran’s capital early Friday, sending shockwaves through Tehran and reigniting fears around the region’s volatile nuclear standoff. Crude oil prices surged as much as 8 percent on Friday and are up around 12 percent for the week — marking their biggest weekly gain since 2022. The spike comes amid escalating Middle East tensions, with JP Morgan warning earlier this week that oil could soar to $130 a barrel in a worst-case scenario. In the previous session, the frontline indices\\xa0gave up early gains and slumped sharply in the final hours of trade, as a broad-based selloff gripped the market. Even the lone gainer, Nifty Pharma, buckled under pressure, while mid and smallcap stocks bore the brunt of the decline, falling harder than the headline indices. FIIs and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth Rs 3,831 crore while DII\\'s net bought Rs 9,393 crore.\\xa0FIIs remain net sellers for 2025 so far, pulling out over Rs\\xa01.24 lakh crore year-to-date. Meanwhile, DIIs have emerged as steady absorbers, with cumulative net purchases exceeding Rs 3.16 lakh crore. Here are the key levels to track on June 13 The index faced rejection near the 25,200 zone and slipped below the 9-EMA, though it continues to hold around the 20-Day SMA. This marks a pause in the ongoing uptrend, hinting at possible consolidation or mild profit booking ahead. The higher highs and higher lows remain intact on the broader time frame, but the bearish engulfing pattern raises near-term caution. The RSI has dropped from 60 to 55, indicating a decline in momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) has risen slightly, increasing intraday volatility. The immediate support remains at 24,800; a break beneath this zone could invite a sharper slide, whereas 25,100 remains a formidable ceiling on the upside. \"The Nifty Bank index saw mild profit booking, pulling back towards the 20-Day SMA, which now acts as immediate support. However, the primary trend remains intact as the price holds well above the medium-term moving averages. The index is currently hovering near the previous breakout zone of 56,000–56,200. A sustained breach below this zone could open the gates for further downside towards the next support at 55,300. On the upside, 56,700 continues to pose immediate resistance. Currently, caution is warranted, as a break below 55,300 may weaken the trend and shift the near-term outlook to negative,\" Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said. The India VIX, the fear index that measures expected market volatility, rebounded but stayed below the 15 mark, closing at 14.02, up 2.54 percent. This remains favourable for the bulls. The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped to 0.92 on June 12, compared to 0.97 in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

       "  'content': \"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to see a gap-down start on June 13, tracking cues from GIFT Nifty trading around 24,758 a short while ago this morning. Benchmark indices sold off on June 12, erasing all of the previous session's gains and snapping a six-day gaining streak, as Nifty 50 closed\\xa0below 24,900 amid broad-based selling. At close, the\\xa0Sensex\\xa0was down 823.16 points or 1 percent at 81,691.98, and the\\xa0Nifty\\xa0was down 253.20 points or 1.01 percent at 24,888.20. The broader indices underperformed the main indices with BSE midcap index down 1.5 percent and smallcap index down 1.3 percent. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower\\xa0at around 24,758, indicating a weak start for the day. Asian Equities (Down) Asian markets were trading\\xa0weak in the early Friday\\xa0after\\xa0attacked Iran's nuclear program sites. US Equities (Gain) The S&P 500 ended higher on Thursday after a strong outlook from Oracle fueled optimism around artificial intelligence, offsetting worries about tension in the Middle East and a drop in Boeing shares. The S&P 500 climbed 0.38% to end the session at 6,045.26 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.24% to 19,662.49 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.24% to 42,967.62 points. US Bond Yield (Down) Yields on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries extended fall on Friday, falling 2 percent each in the early Friday trade. Dollar Index (Up) The U.S. dollar rallied alongside the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc, with currency markets abruptly reversing direction on news Israel had launched strikes on Iran. Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies\\xa0were trading mostly lower in the early Friday trade with\\xa0South Korean Won leading the losers, followed by Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar, Philippines Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar. Crude (Surges) Oil prices jumped more than 7% on Friday to hit the highest in more than two months after Israel said it struck Iran, raising concerns of escalating tensions in the Middle East that could disrupt oil supplies. Gold (Up) Gold\\xa0rose on third day on report of Israel struck targets in Iran. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on second day as they sold equities worth Rs\\xa03,831 crore on June 12, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities of Rs\\xa09,393 crore on the same day.

       "  'content': 'Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex remained deep in the red on June 13 as heavy selling in banking, FMCG, and auto stocks dragged the market lower. While broader indices also declined, the fall was relatively modest compared to the headline gauges. The lone bright spot was the IT pack, which held firm and offered slight stability in an otherwise fragile session. The sentiment took a hit as escalating tensions in the Middle East unnerved investors. A pre-dawn Israeli strike on Iran’s capital reignited fears of a broader conflict, rattling global sentiment and weighing heavily on domestic equities. As a result, Crude oil prices surged as much as 10 percent and are up around 14 percent for the week, marking their biggest weekly gain since 2022. At about 11:35 pm,\\xa0the Sensex was down 678.15 points or 0.83 percent at 81,013.83, and the Nifty was down 208.20 points or 0.84 percent at 24,680.00. About 1215 shares advanced, 2124 shares declined, and 111 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates \"The Israeli strike could have significant economic repercussions if the conflict with Iran drags on. With Israel stating that the operation may continue for several days, Brent crude has already surged nearly 12 percent to $78 a barrel. Prices could climb further if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil supply route. The market\\'s reaction will largely hinge on the duration of the conflict, but in the near term, a risk-off sentiment is likely to dominate,\" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. Defence stocks significantly surged on June 13 as the war between Israel and Iran continued to escalate, fueling hopes of higher defence equipment orders amid heightened global uncertainties. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up 2.5 percent to snap a two-day losing streak. IndiGo and SpiceJet shares crashed up to 4 percent after an Air India Dreamliner en route to London crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people.\\xa0The selloff in aviation stocks was also influenced by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Global sentiment turned risk-averse after Israel launched a strike on Iran’s capital. Indian auto ancillary stocks mainly Sona BLW, Samvardhana Motherson, Bosch, and Uno Minda fell up to 2 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump signalled the possibility of raising tariffs on imported vehicles. The move, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, has stoked fears of renewed trade tensions and potential ripple effects on global supply chains. Most sectoral indices on the NSE traded in the red. Banks led the decline, with Nifty PSU Bank falling 1.33 percent and Nifty Bank dropping 1.15 percent. FMCG and private bank indices also slipped over 1 percent each. The auto, infra, metal, and consumer durables indices declined by around 0.9 percent. Energy, pharma, oil & gas, media, and realty stocks posted smaller losses. Meanwhile, the Nifty IT index managed to eke out a modest gain of 0.13 percent. Broader markets also saw some weakness, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 down 0.46 percent and 0.45 percent, respectively. Notably, India VIX surged 7.85 percent to 15.12, indicating rising market volatility. \"A clear drop below 24,700 could lead to a wedge breakdown, opening the door for a fall towards the recent lows of 24,500–24,400. The next session will be crucial from a short-term perspective, especially since such declines often occur on weekly expiry days—making the follow-through move key. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at 25,000, with the next hurdle at 25,100. Given the likely uptick in volatility, traders should remain cautious and avoid taking aggressive bets,\" Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said. Bharat Electronics, Tech Mahindra, ONGC, Wipro and Apollo Hospital were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Adani Ports, SBI, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, and Bajaj Auto.

Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Ajanta Pharma broke out of its short-term consolidation range in the previous session, backed by robust volume. The stock is now trading comfortably above the 9-day, 20-day, and 50-day EMAs, and is approaching its 200-day SMA. The daily RSI has surged to 64 and is trending upward, without entering the overbought territory, indicating there is ample momentum for a continued upmove. The MACD has triggered a bullish crossover above the signal line, with expanding histogram bars, which highlights a positive setup. The breakout is further confirmed by a volume spike — the highest in over a month. Overall, the trend remains bullish with a higher low structure intact, supporting the possibility of further gains. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,870 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,640 Hyundai Motor India is inching closer to the psychological mark of Rs 2,000. The stock has been in a steady uptrend, forming a sequence of higher highs and higher lows while consistently respecting short-term moving averages. It is currently trading well above its 20-day SMA. The RSI stands at 68 with a positive slope, indicating sustained strength. The MACD has crossed above its signal line and remains in positive territory, with the histogram gradually expanding, which supports the ongoing bullish tone. The ADX is at 24, suggesting the trend is gaining strength following a period of consolidation. Healthy volume activity in recent sessions further supports the ongoing rally. The stock is now approaching a minor supply zone, and a sustained close above Rs 1,980–?2,000 could unlock further upside potential. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,130 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 Cera Sanitaryware has continued its recovery and is now holding above the key Rs 7,000 mark. The stock recently broke out of a consolidation zone with a strong green candle, signaling renewed momentum supported by rising volumes. The formation of higher highs further confirms the bullish trend. It is trading well above its 9-day, 20-day, and 50-day EMAs and has also reclaimed its 200-day SMA. The RSI has improved to 73 and remains comfortably positioned, while the ADX at 43 reflects firm trend strength. A rising +DI line confirms bullish dominance. Increased volume over the past few sessions lends additional support to the uptrend. A breakout above Rs 7,070 could likely extend the rally further. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,780 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Max Healthcare Institute remains comfortably positioned above all its key moving averages — including short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs — reflecting a robust technical structure. On the daily chart, the stock is forming an Ascending Triangle pattern, a bullish continuation formation that suggests the potential for a fresh upward breakout after a phase of consolidation near the highs. The recent price action indicates that the stock is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation range. The structure is further supported by a consistent rise in trading volumes, highlighting accumulation during the consolidation phase. The RSI is at 60.73 and is showing signs of an upward reversal, supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment. The stock’s ability to hold above its critical EMAs reinforces its strength and aligns with the broader positive momentum. From a price action standpoint, it is transitioning from a tight rangebound phase to a potential breakout zone, making the setup attractive from a risk-reward perspective. A decisive and sustained move above the triangle resistance could trigger a fresh rally in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,325 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,140 Shanthi Gears has been consolidating in a broad range after experiencing a sharp 43 percent correction from its peak. Following this decline, the stock has begun to recover, bouncing from lower levels and currently trading within a narrow consolidation band — suggesting potential accumulation. On the daily chart, the stock is hovering near the upper boundary of a falling trendline and appears poised to break out of both the narrow range and the descending resistance line. A sustained move above the Rs 535 level would confirm the breakout and could open the path toward a short-term target of Rs 580. Momentum indicators also favour the bullish outlook. The RSI stands at 63.50 and is trending upward, indicating growing buying interest. The stock is trading comfortably above all its key moving averages — short-term, medium-term, and long-term — reinforcing a bullish alignment across timeframes. From a technical perspective, Shanthi Gears is transitioning from a prolonged consolidation to a breakout zone, with price structure and improving momentum indicators strengthening the case for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 580 Stop-Loss: Rs 496 Nelcast has recently shown signs of a trend reversal after being in a prolonged downtrend, marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows. This structure was broken decisively, signaling a shift in sentiment. Following the breakout from the descending pattern, the stock entered a brief consolidation phase and is now forming a Bullish Pennant pattern — a continuation setup that typically points to further upside. The stock is on the verge of breaking out of this pennant formation, supported by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, which adds credibility to the bullish move. Momentum indicators are aligned with this outlook. The RSI is at 65.44, showing strength and signaling a potential positive crossover. Nelcast is trading comfortably above all its key moving averages — across short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes — indicating strong technical alignment. From both price action and volume perspectives, the stock appears poised for an upward breakout from the pennant pattern, with momentum and technical structure reinforcing the likelihood of a continuation rally. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 153 Stop-Loss: Rs 130',\n",

The market\\'s reaction will largely hinge on the duration of the conflict, but in the near term, a risk-off sentiment is likely to dominate,\" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. Sectoral indices on the NSE traded largely in the red, with the Nifty PSU Bank index leading the losses, down 1.51 percent, followed by Nifty Metal and Nifty Bank, which dropped 1.23 percent and 1.17 percent, respectively. FMCG, Infrastructure, Energy, and Private Bank indices also saw cuts of over 1 percent. Among broader markets, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 declined 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.\\xa0The Nifty IT index, which had opened in the green, ended flat. Meanwhile, India VIX jumped 7.56 percent to 15.08, indicating rising market volatility. Indian shipping stocks were in high demand on June 13, outperforming a weak broader market, as escalating tensions in the Middle East sparked fears of global trade disruptions and rising tanker rates. Shares of Shipping Corporation of India and GE Shipping surged up to 10 percent, emerging as top gainers on the Nifty 500 index. Investor appetite for shipping counters remained strong amid expectations of higher freight and tanker rates, as ships are likely to reroute to avoid the increasingly volatile Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil and gas transport. Defence stocks significantly surged on June 13 as the war between Israel and Iran continued to escalate, fueling hopes of higher defence equipment orders amid heightened global uncertainties. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up 2.5 percent to snap a two-day losing streak. The higher highs and higher lows remain intact on the broader time frame, but the bearish engulfing pattern raises near-term caution. The RSI has dropped from 60 to 55, indicating a decline in momentum. The Average True Range (ATR) has risen slightly, increasing intraday volatility. The immediate support remains at 24,800; a break beneath this zone could invite a sharper slide, whereas 25,100 remains a formidable ceiling on the upside. \"The Nifty Bank index saw mild profit booking, pulling back towards the 20-Day SMA, which now acts as immediate support. However, the primary trend remains intact as the price holds well above the medium-term moving averages. The index is currently hovering near the previous breakout zone of 56,000–56,200. A sustained breach below this zone could open the gates for further downside towards the next support at 55,300. On the upside, 56,700 continues to pose immediate resistance. Currently, caution is warranted, as a break below 55,300 may weaken the trend and shift the near-term outlook to negative,\" Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said.

       "  'content': \"Benchmark indices ended in the red for a second session on June 13, weighed down by rising tensions in the Middle East after Israel’s military strikes on Iran, but a recovery helped the markets close off day's low. Crude oil prices jumped more than 7% in early Friday trade to hit the highest level in more than two months following the Israel strike. Iran said it will deliver a ‘harsh response’ to Israel’s attack on its nuclear installations, Reuters reported citing an Iranian security official. At close, the Sensex was down 573.38 points or 0.70 percent at 81,118.60, and the Nifty was down 169.60 points or 0.68 percent at 24,718.60. The broader indices outperformed with BSE mid and smallcap indices down 0.3 percent each. For the week, BSE Sensex fell 1.3 percent and Nifty shed 1 percent. Stocks & Sectors in Action The biggest Nifty losers were Adani Ports, ITC, SBI, IndusInd Bank, Hindalco Industries, while gainers included Bharat Electronics, ONGC, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Wipro. Except media, all other sectoral indices ended in the red with FMCG, PSU Bank, oil & gas, power, telecom down 0.5-1 percent. Canara Bank shares shed 3.5 percent on plans to raise Rs 9,500 crore via bonds, Kernex Microsystems shares jumped 5 percent on JV getting LoA worth Rs 311 crore, Talbros Automotive Components shares rose 2.5 percent on winning Rs 580 crore multi-year orders, Gensol Engineering shares hit 52-week low after NCLT admitted IREDA plea to start insolvency proceedings. Crude-sensitive stocks remained under pressure as oil surged after Israel’s attack on Iran, while aviation stocks fell for a second day after Air India's Dreamliner Boeing 787-8 plane mishap in Ahmedabad on June 12. Defence stocks, however, witnessed buying interest, fuelling hopes of higher defence equipment orders amid heightened global uncertainties. Global Markets The US stock markets ended higher on Thursday after a strong outlook from Oracle fueled optimism around artificial intelligence, offsetting worries about tension in the Middle East and a drop in Boeing shares. However, the US Futures and Asian markets fell after Israel attacked Iran. Outlook for June 16 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to show weakness on Friday amidst geo-political tension between Israel & Iran and rising International Crude Oil prices. The market slipped into sharp weakness on Friday, but was able to show upside recovery from the lower levels towards end. The overall chart pattern indicates a formation of short-term top reversal pattern at 25222 as per daily timeframe chart. The short-term trend of Nifty is negative, but the medium-term trend remains positive. Nifty seems to have entered a broader high low range of 24500-25100 again. Hence, any sharp weakness below 24500 could possibly trigger sharp selloff. However, any sustainable bounce from the support could pull Nifty towards 25100 levels again in the near term. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets extended Thursday’s decline and ended lower, shedding over half a percent. Weak global cues led to a gap-down start for the Nifty; however, selective buying in heavyweights helped trim some of the losses as the session progressed. Eventually, the index settled at 24,718.60, down 0.68%. Most sectors mirrored the overall trend, with FMCG and banking emerging as the top laggards. The broader indices also remained under pressure, losing nearly half a percent each. The initial reaction was largely driven by a sharp rise in crude oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, a moderation in CPI inflation helped limit the downside. On the technical front, the Nifty slipped below its short-term moving average (20 DEMA) once again but witnessed a swift rebound after testing the lower end of the recent consolidation range (24,500–25,200). This suggests a possibility of continued consolidation in the index. Given the prevailing scenario, traders should maintain a balanced approach with positions on both sides, focusing on stock selection driven by sectoral and thematic trends. It is advisable to avoid aggressive bets and manage risk prudently. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty slipped sharply, breaching the 21-EMA—a key short-term moving average. However, it found support near the recent consolidation lows, leading to a strong intraday recovery. Going forward, the recovery could gain traction if the Nifty sustains above the 24,700 level. On the upside, the index may move towards 25,000 in the short term. Conversely, a decisive fall below 24,700 could trigger renewed bearish bets in the market.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'Wall Street ended sharply lower on Friday after Iran launched missiles at Israel in response to intensive Israeli strikes aimed at crippling Tehran\\'s ability to build nuclear weapons. Explosions were heard and seen over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as sirens sounded across Israel following what the country\\'s military spokesman said was the firing of missiles from Iran. That came after Israel st nuclear facilities and missile factories in Iran, escalating tensions in the Middle East and undermining global investor confidence. Oil prices surged nearly 7% on fears the conflict could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East. U.S. energy stocks rose in tandem, with Exxon up 2.2% and Diamondback Energy rallying 3.7%. “It looks as though we could be in for a full-blown military conflict,\" Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said earlier on Friday. \"If it ends up closing down the Strait of Hormuz, where a third of global oil supply goes through, this could have some pretty nasty effect on global markets.\" Airline stocks fell on fears that fuel costs could climb. Delta Air Lines lost 3.8%, United Airlines fell 4.4% and American Airlines declined 4.9%. Defense stocks climbed, with Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation and Northrop Grumman all gaining over 3%. The S&P 500 declined 1.13% to end the session at 5,976.97 points. The Nasdaq declined 1.30% to 19,406.83 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.79% to 42,197.79 points. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led lower by financials, down 2.06%, followed by a 1.5% loss in information technology. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.9 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 18.2 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions. For the week, the S&P 500 dipped 0.4%, the Nasdaq lost 0.6% and the Dow fell 1.3%. Photoshop maker Adobe fell 5.3% as concerns that the company\\'s pace of AI adoption was too slow overshadowed an increased annual revenue forecast. Oracle jumped 7.7% to a record high, rallying for a second day after the technology company gave an upbeat forecast driven by demand for its AI services. Nvidia dipped 2.1% and Apple lost 1.4%. Visa and Mastercard both fell more than 4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that major retailers are exploring cryptocurrencies, opens new tab that could eliminate the need for payment intermediaries. A tame consumer price report, softer-than-expected producer price data and largely unchanged initial jobless claims earlier this week helped calm investor jitters around tariff-driven price pressures. U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at their meeting next week. With investors betting the United States will reach trade agreements that reduce President Donald Trump\\'s steep trade barriers, the S&P 500 is now trading just below its February record highs. The University of Michigan\\'s Surveys of Consumers showed consumer sentiment improved for the first time in six months in June amid trade uncertainty. Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 6.1-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 10 new highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 131 new lows.\\n       ',\n",

The BSE Sensex declined 1,070.39 points, or 1.3 percent, to settle at 81,118.60, while the Nifty50 shed 284.45 points, or 1.13 percent, ending the week at 24,718.60. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers for the fourth consecutive week, offloading equities worth ₹1,246.51 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) extended their buying streak for the eighth straight week, pumping in ₹18,637.29 crore. On the sectoral front, Nifty Realty led the decline with a 3 percent drop, followed by PSU Bank (-2.3\\xa0percent), FMCG (-2 percent), Bank (-~2 percent), and Metal (-1.5 percent). Bucking the trend, Nifty IT gained 3 percent, while Media and Pharma indices rose over 1 percent each. \"Indian equity markets witnessed heightened volatility this week, ultimately closing in the red. Early optimism, driven by progress in U.S.–China trade negotiations, was overshadowed by escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel launched a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. This development sparked a global risk-off sentiment, leading to a rally in safe-haven assets such as gold and U.S. bonds. Oil prices surged past $76/barrel after months of consolidation, as fears of supply disruptions resurfaced,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. \"On the domestic front, CPI inflation eased to a 75-month low, offering some relief. However, the recent spike in crude prices could reverse this trend if the Middle East conflict intensifies. Sectorally, rate-sensitive segments like auto, realty, and banking saw profit booking, while export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharma gained amid a weaker rupee.\" \"Looking ahead, investors are expected to remain cautious amid premium valuations and geopolitical risks. All eyes are now on the upcoming U.S. Fed meeting, where interest rates are likely to remain unchanged. However, the Fed’s commentary and economic projections will be closely scrutinised for future policy cues,\" he added. The BSE Small-cap index ended on a flat note. Advait Energy Transitions, Rattanindia Enterprises, SMC Global Securities, GOCL Corporation, Suratwwala Business Group, Motisons Jewellers, Electrosteel Castings, Expleo Solutions, Dhani Services, Somany Ceramics added between 20-28 percent, while Sadhana Nitrochem, Orient Cement, Deccan Gold Mines, Harsha Engineers International, Cupid lost between 10-22 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities: The week opened positively, but once again, the market faced resistance near 25,200/82800 and reversed. Technically, on weekly charts, it has formed a long bearish candle and is currently trading comfortably below the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), which is largely negative. We believe that as long as the market remains below the 20-day SMA or 24,850/81600, weak sentiment is likely to continue. On the downside, the market could retest the level of 24,500/80500. A breach of 24,500/80500 could accelerate selling pressure. Below this level, the index could slip to the 50-day SMA around 24,300/79900. On the upside, a break above 24,750/81300 could extend the pullback move up to 24,850/81600. Further gains may also continue, lifting the market toward 24,950–25,000/81900-82100. For Bank Nifty, the key support zone is between 55,000 and 55,200. Above this range, it could bounce back toward 56,100–56,300. Conversely, a fall below 55,000 increases the likelihood of testing the 50-day SMA or 54,500. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services We expect market focus to remain on oil exploration companies on the back of rise in crude prices amidst the backdrop of escalation in Israel-Iran military action. Further, any such escalation would have a positive rub off effect on domestic defence companies on expectation of increased export orders amidst higher defence spending. Overall, we expect the market to remain subdued on the back of weak global cues, while industry-specific news flows would continue to drive sectoral movements.',\n",

Shares of Shipping Corporation of India and GE Shipping surged up to 10 percent, emerging as top gainers on the Nifty 500 index. Investor appetite for shipping counters remained strong amid expectations of higher freight and tanker rates, as ships are likely to reroute to avoid the increasingly volatile Strait of Hormuz — critical artery for global oil and gas transport. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear sites — which reportedly killed several top commanders and scientists — comes just as the two-month deadline set by US President Donald Trump for a nuclear deal with Iran expired. The UN nuclear watchdog had recently passed a resolution accusing Iran of violating non-proliferation commitments, prompting Iran to pledge an acceleration in its nuclear program. The Strait of Hormuz, a narrow chokepoint just 21 miles wide, is vital for global energy supply — handling nearly 30 percent of seaborne oil and 20 percent of global LNG. Any threat to this passage could send oil and freight prices soaring. Although Iran has long threatened to shut the strait, doing so would severely damage Gulf economies and strain its trade ties with China — a key oil customer. For India, any\\xa0disruption or closure of the Strait of Hormuz can impact\\xa0oil prices and shipping costs.\\xa0Since India imports over 80 percent of its crude oil—much of it from Gulf nations like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait—any blockade of this key maritime route would tighten global oil supply and send crude prices soaring. Shipping costs would also shoot up, as tankers would need to take longer routes around Africa or avoid the region altogether, reducing vessel availability and pushing freight rates higher. Wile this would be a concern for importers and the overall economy, shipping companies like Shipping Corporation of India and GE Shipping could benefit from the spike in tanker rates.\",\n",
